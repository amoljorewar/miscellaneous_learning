# Single Sign-On (SSO) VS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

## SSO (Single Sign-On)
Single sign-on (SSO) is a user authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.

### Benefits of SSO
- Allows users to access multiple applications or services with one set of login credentials.
- Can improve user experience, simplify login processes, and reduce password-related support issues.

### Considerations
- SSO can be a single point of failure.
- It can be dependent on the SSO provider's reliability and security standards.

## SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML standard that enables secure web domains to exchange user authentication and authorization data.

### Benefits of SAML
- SAML is an interoperable standard that is widely accepted to communicate a user's identity to cloud service providers.
- Provides additional context to organizations that use a combination of local, web, and cloud-based services.

### Considerations
- SAML can be complex to set up and configure.
- Requires regular updates and maintenance.

## SSO and SAML Together
SSO and SAML can work together to provide a single sign-on environment that reduces the time users spend switching applications and entering login details.
