# YubiKey

A YubiKey is a hardware device that helps users verify their identity through multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## How it works
A YubiKey is a small, USB flash drive-like device that plugs into a device's port and has a button on the side. When prompted to authenticate, the user presses the button on the YubiKey to grant access to their account or device.

## Features
YubiKeys support multiple authentication protocols, including one-time passwords (OTPs), public-key cryptography, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 protocols. They also offer features like static passwords, OpenPGP, and PIV-compatible smart cards.

## Benefits
YubiKeys are resistant to phishing because they handle authentication offline and don't rely on a digital interface. They are also low-cost, don't require a battery or internet connection, and can be used across any tech stack.

## Compatibility
YubiKeys are compatible with USB-A, USB-C, and Lightning ports, as well as NFC on supported devices.

## Use cases
YubiKeys are used by many apps, online services, and computers to enforce 2FA. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook use YubiKeys to secure employee and end-user accounts.

Yubico manufactures YubiKeys. They also offer a similar, lower-cost device called the Secu
