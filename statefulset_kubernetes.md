# Kubernetes StatefulSet

## Persistent Identity
In Kubernetes, a **StatefulSet** is a workload API object that manages a group of pods and ensures each pod has a unique, persistent identity.

StatefulSets assign each pod a unique identifier, such as a persistent hostname or volume, that persists even if the pod is recreated.

## Pod Management
StatefulSets manage the deployment and scaling of pods, and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these pods.

## Persistent Storage
StatefulSets can use storage volumes to provide persistence for a workload.

## Automated Updates
StatefulSets provide automated rolling updates that let you predict which replicas will be affected by scaling operations.

## Use Cases
StatefulSets are useful for managing applications that need:
- Persistent storage
- A stable, unique network identity
- To function correctly, where each instance must be aware of the other instances controlling it

## StatefulSets vs Deployments
StatefulSets are different from **Deployments**, which are stateless and work best with applications that don't need permanent storage or care which network they use. 

### Examples of Stateless Apps
- Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Tomcat.

### Examples of Stateful Applications
- Solr database clusters
- MySQL clusters
- Redis
- Kafka
- MongoDB
