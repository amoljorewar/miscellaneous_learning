# FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2)

FIDO2 is an open standard for user authentication that aims to strengthen security and protect users from cybercrime.

## What it does
FIDO2 allows users to authenticate to online services using common devices, such as mobile devices or desktops. It replaces passwords with a combination of biometrics, PINs, or FIDO2 security keys.

## How it works
FIDO2 uses phishing-resistant cryptographic credentials to validate user identities. FIDO2 security keys, also known as hardware tokens, are external devices that connect to endpoint devices through USB, NFC, or Bluetooth. Users authenticate by inserting or tapping the key, often in combination with a PIN.

## Who developed it
The FIDO Alliance, an industry consortium of Microsoft and other technology, commercial, and government organizations, developed FIDO2.

## What it builds on
FIDO2 builds on earlier FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) protocols and combines the best features of U2F and UAF (Universal Authentication Framework).

## What it supports
FIDO2 supports step-up authentication, allowing use of strong single factor (passwordless), two-factor, and multi-factor authentication.
