| **Feature**            | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**         | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Reliability**         | Reliable; ensures data delivery and retransmits lost packets | Unreliable; no guarantee of delivery, order, or error correction |
| **Connection**          | Connection-oriented (requires handshake)        | Connectionless (no connection setup)   |
| **Speed**               | Slower due to error-checking, acknowledgments, and retransmissions | Faster due to minimal overhead         |
| **Flow Control**        | Yes; manages congestion and ensures receiver is not overwhelmed | No flow control; sends data without consideration for the receiver's capacity |
| **Error Checking**      | Yes; provides mechanisms for error detection and correction | Yes; provides error detection (checksum), but no correction |
| **Order**               | Ensures data is received in the correct order   | Does not guarantee packet order        |
| **Use Cases**           | Applications requiring reliability: web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP) | Applications where speed is more important than reliability: video streaming, online gaming, VoIP |
