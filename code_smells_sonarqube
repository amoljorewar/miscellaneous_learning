# SonarQube Code Smells

## Definition
In SonarQube, a **code smell** is a warning sign in a codebase that indicates a potential issue.

Code smells are symptoms in a program's source code that may indicate a deeper problem. They are not errors, and the code will still work, but they can make future development harder and increase the risk of bugs.

## Examples
Code smells can include:
- Duplicated code
- Long methods
- Inconsistent naming conventions

## How SonarQube Helps
SonarQube is a tool that can help identify and address code smells.

## How to Address
**Refactoring** is a way to address code smells. Refactoring is like flossing for code; it's a regular maintenance practice that keeps things healthy.
