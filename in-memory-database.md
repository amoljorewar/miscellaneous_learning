# In-Memory Database (IMDB)

An **in-memory database (IMDB)** is a type of database that stores data primarily in the system's main memory (RAM), rather than on disk storage. This approach allows for much faster data access and processing compared to traditional disk-based databases, which rely on slower disk read/write operations.

## Key Features of In-Memory Databases:

1. **Speed**: Since RAM is much faster than disk storage, data retrieval and manipulation are significantly quicker.
2. **Volatility**: Data in an in-memory database is typically lost when the system is powered off, although some IMDBs provide persistence mechanisms like periodic snapshots or write-through to disk.
3. **Use Cases**: They are ideal for applications that require high-speed data access, such as:
   - Real-time analytics
   - Caching layers
   - Session management
   - High-frequency trading

## Popular Examples:
- **Redis**
- **Memcached**
- **SAP HANA**
